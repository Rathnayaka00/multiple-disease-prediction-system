Multiple Disease Prediction System
This Streamlit-based application predicts the likelihood of diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. Using separate machine learning models for each disease, the app enables users to input relevant health metrics and receive real-time predictions. Additionally, it offers health recommendations (powered by a Generative AI model) for those with positive diagnoses. Note: This is not a substitute for medical advice. Always consult healthcare professionals.

Directory Structure
Data Set/: Contains CSV files (diabetes.csv, heart.csv, parkinsons.csv) with relevant data for training and evaluation.
Note Books/: Jupyter notebooks (diabetes.ipynb, heart.ipynb, parkinsons.ipynb) for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
models/: Contains serialized machine learning models (diabetes_model.sav, heart_disease_model.sav, parkinsons_model.sav).
app.py: The main Streamlit application file that loads models and serves the prediction interface.
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
Key Features
Disease Prediction: Model-based predictions for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.
Health Recommendations: Personalized guidance generated by an AI assistant based on input values.
User Interface: Interactive UI built with Streamlit, allowing users to input health metrics and select prediction models easily.
